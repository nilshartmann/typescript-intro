# Let's type - A practical introduction to TypeScript for Java Developers

## Abstract

In the recent releases of JavaScript/ECMAScript a lot of features have been added, that make working with the language way more easy and comfortable than before. But there is still no type system and as we know from developing our Java applications. A type system that would help us avoiding bugs while writing code or that would allow us to safely refactor our code.
Luckily there’s a solution: TypeScript, a language based on JavaScript, that adds a very powerful type system to JavaScript. In this talk I will show you the concepts and syntax of TypeScript with a lot of code examples, so you can see how good or bad the type system is (compared to Java). I will also show you the current state of IDE support, debugging possibilities or migration strategies for existing code , so that you get an impression how it feels to develop with TypeScript and that you can make a decision, whether TypeScript could be useful for your projects.

## Demo

* (Intro with Slides)
  * What is TypeScript
  * TypeScript sits on top of JavaScript, is not a "replacement"
  * Types are removed after compilation
* Intro VS Code
  * Very good TS Support
  * (even with JavaScript)
* Basic Syntax
* Own Types
* Type Guards (Data Source Example)
* React Apps
* Debugging React Apps with Chrome (and/or VS Code)
